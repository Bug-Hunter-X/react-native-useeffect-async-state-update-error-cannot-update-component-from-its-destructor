This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a callback function that attempts to modify the component's state asynchronously.  The problem arises because the component might unmount before the asynchronous operation completes, leading to a `Cannot update a component from its destructor` error. This typically happens when a state update is attempted after the component has been unmounted.
